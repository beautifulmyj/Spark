If you have worked with a JVM-based application you have probably heard the term classpath The classpath defines where the JVM will search for a given classfile when it needs to be loaded There may only be one instance of a classfile on each classpath forcing any dependency Flink exposes onto users That is why the Flink community works hard to keep our classpath clean or free of unnecessary dependencies We achieve this through a combination of shaded dependencies child first class loading and a plugins abstraction for optional components
